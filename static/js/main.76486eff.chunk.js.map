My name is Sharan and Iâ€™m 33 years old, female and from England. I have been living in Berlin for 1 year now and I really love this city. I work as a receptionist and bartender. I have a great team that Iâ€™m lucky to work with and also, I have just finished my course to become an English tutor/teacher ðŸ˜Š. As a roommate Iâ€™m really responsible, clean and I always pay rent on time. It would be great to live with people who are friendly and like to have a drink or something but I also love spending time alone. Iâ€™m a pretty great flatmate, very easygoing ðŸ˜Š. I love having a happy, peaceful vibe in my home but also love having a laugh! I can also be quiet around the home... like I said, Iâ€™m very easy going! In my spare time I like to chill with friends and go explore Berlin as much as possible... Would love to go check out more bars but letâ€™s see when these restrictions lift ðŸ¥º I also love travelling and taking mini breaks. Music wise Iâ€™m into hip hop, house... a lot of music really! But Iâ€™m also not loud so I wonâ€™t blast music. I like chatting about general funny things in life, politics, the current state of the world, music, food. I also love cooking and Iâ€™m trying to get into fitness now that I have finished my course. It would be great to find a long term room, but Iâ€™m also happy with seeing how it goes! Can I ask is Anmeldung available there? Iâ€˜d be really grateful if I hear from you! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™ve attached a photo of me if it helps to picture who I am. Hope you have a great day!

And I can proudly say that also my pancakes for a spontaneous brunch at home are getting better and better (or edible, let\\'s put it this way) :) but I also love to be outside and to enjoy the nice weather with friends. I work in a small company in Wedding and occasionally also as an ice cream seller in Mitte, because I enjoy talking to the guests so much (but due to corona paused) :) In my free time I love to meet friends for home cooked dinners or game nights, and other than that I love to learn languages. I love about whales how these mammals are so graceful and show just the same emotions as us. I also find their ways of communicating over a distance of many kilometres very fascinating. I this is it about me - and whales - as for now. I would love to get to know you all over a beer or wine in person sometime soon :) until then all the best :) Dindia'}\n      </h1>\n      <br />\n      <h1>{'#3 (Johannes):'}</h1>\n      <br />\n      <h1>\n        {'Hi Richard, I just found your offer on WG-gesucht and your appartment looks like the perfect mix: Lots of shared space for living together, a perfect location and even a garden! :) At the moment I am sadly leaving my last WG for a switch to Berlin beginning at a startup in an industry a little bit unusual (at least for me): We sell organic tampons. After seven years in Munich, where I started with a Traineeprogram at a publishing house, it was time for a new challenge in a more relaxed city. I also never would have thought that I would last that long in Bavaria. Besides work, which keeps my life fairly regular during the week, I like to spend my time: ...in the kitchen producing either a quick pasta, pickels or preparing meals with several courses - my motto is to be able to produce a three course meal from the fridge for spontaneous visits of friends (this is real and not here just for your requirements) ...doing sports on the bike in summer or snowboarding in the winter - the Corona-yoga did not yet stick with me ...with friends exploring bars, travelling or at festivals - which obviously is all a little bit difficult at the moment. Also I am mostly out of the woods here, as I am 36 years old (which you would not believe at first glance). ...with a good book or movie - ranging from Midsomar, Fighting with my Family to Cold War, just to name some last watched ones. Best movies with whales in leading, supporting or just role on the poster: Blackfish, Rust and Bone and Leviathan. For reading I am trying to get through Berlin Alexanderplatz for the tenth time at the moment, maybe living here helps. :) To finish with the basics: Originally from Hamburg I left the town for university and have lived in many constellations over the years from the Pfalz to Russia - from a Studentenwohnheim with nine others, easy going shared flats with one to four room mates to even alone for some time. Your description of the WG seems perfect here: A good mix of shared and own life with generally open doors. I am a non-smoker, respectful, clean without an OCD, and would not bring any pets besides a branch of the newly developed corona sour dough. I would be happy to get to know you personally - then we could also see, if itâ€˜s a fit. You can reach me at 0172-4363849 or jdiederi@gmail.com - I am looking forward to hearing from you!

Ich bin 29 Jahre alt und Masterstudentin in Stadtplanung. Derzeit wohne ich bis Ende August in Stuttgart. Ich bin auf der Suche nach einem Zimmer zum Wohnen ab dem 1. September 2020 (bis Januar 2021, aber mit der MÃ¶glichkeit der VerlÃ¤ngerung bis 6 Monate). Am liebsten teile ich die WG mit dem gesellschaftlichen Leben, weil ich gerne etwas unternehme, mich unterhalte und Gedanken austausche. NatÃ¼rlich kÃ¶nnen wir zusammen Bier trinken. Ich interessiere mich fÃ¼r Ihr Angebot, weil ich mich fÃ¼r ein Praktikum in Berlin bewerbe. NeukÃ¶lln ist ein lebendiger Stadtteil und ich mÃ¶chte diesen Stadtteil auch fÃ¼r mein zukÃ¼nftiges AbschluÃŸarbeitsthema forschern. Neben meinem Studentenleben bin ich auch als Konzertfotografin tÃ¤tig und dokumentiere meistens Auftritte mit psychedelischer Musik. Konzerte machen mir sehr viel SpaÃŸ. Ich komme aus Indonesien und ich koche sehr gerne, vor allem asiatische Gerichte. Am Wochenende gehe ich gerne im Wald oder im Stadtpark spazieren Ich spreche Englisch und sehr wenig Deutsch. Aus dem Grund hÃ¤tte ich gerne mehr Deutsch lernen und ich freue mich auf neue Leute kennenzulernen.
