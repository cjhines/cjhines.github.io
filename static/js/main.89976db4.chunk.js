My name is Sharan and I\u2019m 33 years old, female and from England. I have been living in Berlin for 1 year now and I really love this city. I work as a receptionist and bartender. I have a great team that I\u2019m lucky to work with and also, I have just finished my course to become an English tutor/teacher \ud83d\ude0a. As a roommate I\u2019m really responsible, clean and I always pay rent on time. It would be great to live with people who are friendly and like to have a drink or something but I also love spending time alone. I\u2019m a pretty great flatmate, very easygoing \ud83d\ude0a. I love having a happy, peaceful vibe in my home but also love having a laugh! I can also be quiet around the home... like I said, I\u2019m very easy going! In my spare time I like to chill with friends and go explore Berlin as much as possible... Would love to go check out more bars but let\u2019s see when these restrictions lift \ud83e\udd7a I also love travelling and taking mini breaks. Music wise I\u2019m into hip hop, house... a lot of music really! But I\u2019m also not loud so I won\u2019t blast music. I like chatting about general funny things in life, politics, the current state of the world, music, food. I also love cooking and I\u2019m trying to get into fitness now that I have finished my course. It would be great to find a long term room, but I\u2019m also happy with seeing how it goes! Can I ask is Anmeldung available there? I\u2018d be really grateful if I hear from you! \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019ve attached a photo of me if it helps to picture who I am. Hope you have a great day!

And I can proudly say that also my pancakes for a spontaneous brunch at home are getting better and better (or edible, let's put it this way) :) but I also love to be outside and to enjoy the nice weather with friends. I work in a small company in Wedding and occasionally also as an ice cream seller in Mitte, because I enjoy talking to the guests so much (but due to corona paused) :) In my free time I love to meet friends for home cooked dinners or game nights, and other than that I love to learn languages. I love about whales how these mammals are so graceful and show just the same emotions as us. I also find their ways of communicating over a distance of many kilometres very fascinating. I this is it about me - and whales - as for now. I would love to get to know you all over a beer or wine in person sometime soon :) until then all the best :) Dindia"),n.a.createElement("br",null),n.a.createElement("h1",null,"#3 (Johannes):"),n.a.createElement("br",null),n.a.createElement("h1",null,"Hi Richard, I just found your offer on WG-gesucht and your appartment looks like the perfect mix: Lots of shared space for living together, a perfect location and even a garden! :) At the moment I am sadly leaving my last WG for a switch to Berlin beginning at a startup in an industry a little bit unusual (at least for me): We sell organic tampons. After seven years in Munich, where I started with a Traineeprogram at a publishing house, it was time for a new challenge in a more relaxed city. I also never would have thought that I would last that long in Bavaria. Besides work, which keeps my life fairly regular during the week, I like to spend my time: ...in the kitchen producing either a quick pasta, pickels or preparing meals with several courses - my motto is to be able to produce a three course meal from the fridge for spontaneous visits of friends (this is real and not here just for your requirements) ...doing sports on the bike in summer or snowboarding in the winter - the Corona-yoga did not yet stick with me ...with friends exploring bars, travelling or at festivals - which obviously is all a little bit difficult at the moment. Also I am mostly out of the woods here, as I am 36 years old (which you would not believe at first glance). ...with a good book or movie - ranging from Midsomar, Fighting with my Family to Cold War, just to name some last watched ones. Best movies with whales in leading, supporting or just role on the poster: Blackfish, Rust and Bone and Leviathan. For reading I am trying to get through Berlin Alexanderplatz for the tenth time at the moment, maybe living here helps. :) To finish with the basics: Originally from Hamburg I left the town for university and have lived in many constellations over the years from the Pfalz to Russia - from a Studentenwohnheim with nine others, easy going shared flats with one to four room mates to even alone for some time. Your description of the WG seems perfect here: A good mix of shared and own life with generally open doors. I am a non-smoker, respectful, clean without an OCD, and would not bring any pets besides a branch of the newly developed corona sour dough. I would be happy to get to know you personally - then we could also see, if it\u2018s a fit. You can reach me at 0172-4363849 or jdiederi@gmail.com - I am looking forward to hearing from you!
